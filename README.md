# Assignment 1

## Background
The purpose of this assignment is to determine the basic problem solving and design skill of an
Algorithm engineer candidate.

## Our little story of dream
Jane studied software. But the job was completely indoor. So she became part time
postwoman. It’s exciting. She can visit different places every day in her town. Everyday she
goes to the post office to collect all the letters. And then she starts delivering them. She is not
like her colleagues who try to deliver as fast as possible. She wants to utilize this time to visit
different places. Hence she takes longer routes. Everytime she collects the posts from post
office, her boss suggests a route that she should use. She never follows that. Jane is quite
passionate about programming. She wants to automate the whole process. She want to visit
new places every now and then. If she can make it, she will sell this to her travel hungry
friends who have a similar job. Jane does not want to take too much time delivering her
packages since her boss will notice her inefficiency. Therefore, Jane doesn't mind if she
doesn't get to see everything on her first day.

## Expected Outcome
- It’s always better to start from designing the software
- A functional software that Jane can use to meet her travel hunger.
- Any question about the problem should be answered in assumptions.
- A full flexed service
- Surprise us!
